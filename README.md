# Plant pathology 🌿🍎

This repository contains notebooks and scripts to train neural network classifier on Plant Pathology 2020 Kaggle comptetition data. The model will be then used in Android application 📲, in order to make it possible for people to use it.

Hopefully it turns out to be usefull for someone 👩🏼‍🌾.

# Comptetition problem statement:
```diff
+ Misdiagnosis of the many diseases impacting agricultural crops can lead to misuse of 
+ chemicals leading to the emergence of  resistant pathogen strains, increased input costs, 
+ and more outbreaks with significant economic loss and environmental impacts. 

+ Current disease diagnosis based on human scouting is time-consuming and expensive, 
+ and although computer-vision based models have the promise to increase efficiency, 
+ the great variance in symptoms due to age of infected tissues, genetic variations, 
+ and  light conditions within trees decreases the accuracy of detection.
```

The source code for the app will be stored in separate repository.
